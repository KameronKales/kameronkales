Hey I'm Kam. Im an expert front end developer familiar with multiple frameworks and libraries. 

I write clean, extendable code and build teams that do too. 

Working at Vanguard helping implement single spa, so lots of teams can build and deploy safely. 

I am available for part time consulting work to help your organization do the same.
